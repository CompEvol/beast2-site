Codon substitution model describe evolution at the codon level allow the estimation of measures of 
the selective forces acting on proteins [(Kosiol et. al. 2000)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/24/7/1464/986344). 
The M0, also called as GY94, is first published by [Goldman & Yang 1994](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/11/5/725/1008711), 
and late designated to be one of the M-series (M0-M13) proposed by [Yang et al. 2000](http://www.genetics.org/content/155/1/431.short).
