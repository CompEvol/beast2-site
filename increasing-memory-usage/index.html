<h2>Increasing the Memory available to BEAST and the utility programs</h2>
<p>If an application fails to launch with the following error:</p>
<dl>
<dd><code>"java.lang.OutofMemoryError: Java heap space"</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>The solution is to tell Java to use more memory when loading the program. How this is done depends on which version of the program you are using.</p>
<h2>Mac OS X version</h2>
<ol>
<li>Right-click (or Control-click if you are using a 1-button mouse) on the BEAST application icon:</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-359 size-full" src="..//files/2015/05/Rightclick.png" alt="Rightclick" width="327" height="306" srcset="http://beast2.org/files/2015/05/Rightclick.png 327w, http://beast2.org/files/2015/05/Rightclick-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" /></p>
<p>Now go into the folder called &#8220;Contents&#8221; and find the file called &#8216;info.plist&#8217;. Double-clicking this file should open it in an application called &#8220;Property List Editor&#8221; (this can be found in your Developer/Applications/Utility folder if it doesn&#8217;t open automatically, but you will need to have installed the Developer Tools). In this program open the section called &#8220;Java&#8221; and edit the string labelled &#8220;VMOptions&#8221;:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-360 size-full" src="..//files/2015/05/Plist.png" alt="Plist" width="610" height="560" srcset="http://beast2.org/files/2015/05/Plist.png 610w, http://beast2.org/files/2015/05/Plist-300x275.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will have the format: <code>-Xms64M -Xmx256M</code>, where the -Xmx and -Xms commands determine the maximum and starting amount of memory that java is provided (the M after each number specifies that it is in megabytes). You can now increase the -Xmx option to something larger. Then save the &#8220;info.plist&#8221; file, close the folders and try running the program again.</p>
<p><i>Note: if you don&#8217;t have the &#8216;Property List Editor&#8217; installed, you can load the &#8216;info.plist&#8217; into a text editor &#8211; find the string that looks like the one above and edit it.</i></p>
<p>This technique can also be used to increase the memory for the other BEAST-related programs such as <a class="new" title="LogCombiner (page does not exist)" href="../programs/index.html">LogCombiner</a>, <a title="TreeAnnotator" href="http://beast2.org/treeannotator">TreeAnnotator</a> and <a title="Tracer" href="http://beast2.org/tracer-2">Tracer</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using the command-line version of BEAST on Mac OS X, then see the next section.</p>
<h2>UNIX and Linux versions</h2>
<p>A solution to this problem is to run BEAST via the command line using the following command:</p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight xml %}java -Xms64m -Xmx256m -jar lib/beast.jar{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p>The -Xmx and -Xms commands determine the maximum and starting amount of memory that java is provided (the M after each number specifies that it is in megabytes). Try increasing the -Xmx number to something larger.</p>
<p>In many cases, BEAST and the other programs will be run by calling the executable shell scripts in the <code>BEAST.v1.4/bin</code> directory. If you edit these, you will see a java command similar to the above and you can adjust the memory usage as required.</p>
<h2>Windows version</h2>
<p>This is more difficult because the Windows executables are not editable. However the beast.jar files can be found in the <code>BEAST v1.4/lib</code> folder and you can use the command in the UNIX version, above, to run BEAST using the command line:</p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight xml %}java -Xms64m -Xmx256m -jar lib/beast.jar{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
