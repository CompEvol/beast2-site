<h2>Downloading BEAST for Linux</h2>
<p>The BEAST Download should be under way.
<p>Once the file is downloaded, uncompress the file (<code>tar fxz BEAST.v2.6.0.Linux.tgz</code>) which creates a <code>beast</code> directory.
<p>Start BEAST, BEAUti or the other programs from a terminal using any of the scripts in <code>beast/bin</code>.

<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>
<h3>Starting issues</h3>
<p> BEAST requires Java version 8 or higher, which you can get from your package manager, or from Adopt, e.g <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">here</a>.

<h3>Download issues</h3>
<p>If the download failed, you can always get it from the <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/releases">release page</a>.
