<h2>Downloading BEAST for Windows</h2>
<p>The BEAST Download should be under way.
<p>Once the file is downloaded, unzip the file and start BEAST, BEAUti or the other programs by double clicking the icon in the BEAST directory.

<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>
<h3>Download issues</h3>
<p>If the download failed, you can always get it from the <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/releases">release page</a>.

<h3>BEAST does not start</h3>
<p>BEAST requires Java version 8 or higher and won't start without it.
You can get Java from Adopt, e.g <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">here</a>.
