			{% highlight xml %}Error 124 parsing the xml input file

This plugin (alignment) has no input with name dataTypeX. Choose one of these inputs: sequence,statecount,dataType,userDataType,strip

Error detected about here:
  
<beast>	 	 
    <data id='alignment'>      {% endhighlight %}

<dl>
<dd>In this case, although the input file was a valid XML document, there was an error in the syntax that BEAST requires. For example, above, a data-element does not conform to the requirement that inputs should be named one of sequence, statecount, dataType, userDataType, and strip.</dd>
