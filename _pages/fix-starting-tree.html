title: Fix starting tree

		<p>To start the tree with a tree in Newick format, you need the TreeParser to initialise the tree. You can insert this in the XML by editing it (this is not possible in BEAUti yet) for example, like so:</p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight xml %}<stateNode spec='beast.util.TreeParser' id='Tree.t:xyz' IsLabelledNewick='true' adjustTipHeights='false'
 taxa='@xyz'
 newick="chimp:0.009603178109055574,bonobo:0.009603178109055574):0.01049225186311567):0.013418689384830318):0.02460624740645495,orangutan:0.05812036676345651):0.010656607109573349,siamang:0.06877697387302986);"/>{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p>It is a bit tricky, because you have to ensure that</p>
<ul>
<li>the id (here id=&#8217;Tree.t:xyz&#8217;) is the same as in your original file.</li>
<li>taxa refers to the alignment so it knows the order of taxa. If your alignment has id=&#8217;xyz&#8217; then add taxa=&#8217;@xyz&#8217;.</li>
<li>the element name (here stateNode) should be the same as in the original file.</li>
<li>if the tree is supposed to be ultrametric, that is, all the tips have the same age then also set adjustTipHeights to true.</li>
<li>if there is an initaliser generated by BEAUti of the form</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight xml %}   <init estimate="false" id="RandomTree.t:xxx" initial="@Tree.t:xxx" spec="beast.evolution.tree.RandomTree" taxa="@xxx">{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p>remove this element from the file, otherwise the tree will be Newick tree will be overwritten by a random tree.</p>
<ul>
<li>if you added constraints to the RandomTree in &#8220;constraint&#8221;-elements, these should not be moved to TreeParser. TreeParser does not rely on constraints to initialise, so these constraints should be moved outside the RandomTree to the top level of the XML (just inside the &#8220;beast&#8221;-element).</li>
</ul>
