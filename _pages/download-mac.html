<h2>Downloading BEAST for Mac</h2>
<p>The BEAST Download should be under way.
<p>Once the file is downloaded, open the dmg file by double clicking it, and drag the BEAST folder into the Application folder in the window that pops up.

<p>Start BEAST, BEAUti or the other programs by double clicking the icon in the <code>BEAST </code> directory in the Application folder.
<p>You can also start them from a terminal using any of the scripts in <code>/Applications/BEAST v2.6.7/bin</code>.

<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>

<h3>BEAST on Big Sur</h3>
<p>If there is an <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/issues/1003">issue</a> with starting BEAST v2.6.7 on OS X Big Sur showing this message:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/512538/134654992-9ff0380a-d27a-4acd-b210-90fc37c1887f.png"/>
please download the version with the JRE included <a href="http://www.beast2.org/download-mac-with-jre/">here</a> and drag to the Applications folder.

<h3>BEAST does not start</h3>
<p>If BEAST or BEAUti does not launch, this is probably due to Java not being installed, or the default version of Java is not Java 8 or higher.
<p>To fix this, install java, e.g. from Adopt, available <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">here</a>.
<p>On Mojave, installing later version could prevent BEAST from starting, but installing Java 8 before installing a later version seems to work</p>

<h3>Download issues</h3>
<p>If the download failed, you can always get it from the <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/releases">release page</a>.
