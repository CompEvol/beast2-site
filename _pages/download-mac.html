<h2>Downloading BEAST for Mac</h2>
<p>The BEAST Download should be under way.
<p>Once the file is downloaded, open the dmg file by double clicking it, and drag the BEAST folder into the Application folder in the window that pops up.

<p>Start BEAST, BEAUti or the other programs by double clicking the icon in the <code>BEAST </code> directory in the Application folder.
<p>You can also start them from a terminal using any of the scripts in <code>/Applications/BEAST v2.6.6/bin</code>.

<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>
<h3>BEAST does not start</h3>
<p>If BEAST or BEAUti does not launch, this is probably due to Java not being installed, or the default version of Java is not Java 8 or higher.
<p>To fix this, install java, e.g. from Adopt, available <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">here</a>.
<p>On Mojave, installing later version could prevent BEAST from starting, but installing Java 8 before installing a later version seems to work</p>
<p>&nbsp;
<h3>Download issues</h3>
<p>If the download failed, you can always get it from the <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/releases">release page</a>.
