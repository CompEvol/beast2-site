<p>Most significant upcoming changes are</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotated constructor support, so instead of using <tt>Input</tt> and <tt>initAndValidate</tt> you can use constructors and use most of the info that now goes into and <tt>Input</tt> in a <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/blob/master/src/beast/core/Param.java"><tt>@Param</tt></a> annotation. See, for example <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/blob/master/src/test/beast/util/AnnotatedRunnableTestClass.java">AnnotatedRunnableTestClass</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/blob/master/src/test/beast/util/JSONTest.java">JSONTest</a>.
<li>Better JSON support for BEAST specifications, using a non-evil JSON library.</li>
<li>Removal of <tt>Exception</tt>s in favour of classes that derive from <tt>Exception</tt>. This means that many methods that previously were throwing Exceptions, are throwing more specialised Exceptions, or nothing at all (if only RuntimeExceptions are thrown).</li>
<li>Cleaned up code, better conforming to Java 8 constructions and naming conventions. Also, attempt to remove the term &#8216;Plugin&#8217; and replace with BEAST object where appropriate, since the term plugin is not used any more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code changes</h2>
<p>This is a (still evolving) list of changes for package developers containing possible changes required to make packages compatible with BEAST v2.4.0. Mostly, there are minor method signature changes, and some member variables name changes, with the exception of Exceptions. </p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>However, the biggest change is that <tt>throws Exception</tt> on <tt>initAndValidate</tt> will be removed. <tt>initAndValidate</tt> is supposed to check validity of values of inputs, and initialise. If for some reason this fails, the most appropriate exception to throw is <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt> or <tt>RuntimeException</tt>.</p>
<p>Note you can always throw fewer exceptions than the method derived from, so you can change your code to work with both v2.3 and v2.4 by just removing or specialising the exception that is thrown.</p>
<h3>Signature changes</h3>
<p>The signature of <tt>BeautiDoc.deepCopyPlugin</tt> changes: requires an extra argument to tell which partition to copy from.</p>
<h3>Access changes</h3>
<p>A number of package private member and methods now are protected to allow access from difference packages.<br />
<tt>BeautiAlignmentProvider.getAlignments()</tt>,</p>
<p>Most inputs are now <tt>final</tt>, so cannot be re-assigned.</p>
<h3>Name changes</h3>
<p><tt>SubtreeSlide.fSize</tt> is now <tt>SubtreeSlide.size</tt><br />
<tt>InputEditor.m_plugin</tt> is now <tt>InputEditor.beastObject</tt><br />
<tt>BeautiConfig.inlinePlugin, collapsedPlugins, suppressPlugins</tt> are now <tt>inlineBEASTObject, collapsedBEASTObjects, suppressBEASTObjects</tt></p>
<h3>Deprecated</h3>
<p><tt>BEASTObject.outputs</tt> is now private. Use <tt>BEASTObject.getOutputs()</tt> to access the set of outputs.</p>
