A developer guide is available through the [DeveloperManual](https://github.com/rbouckaert/DeveloperManual) project. The guide talks about procedures to test the models you develop and provides tools through the [beast-validation](https://github.com/christiaanjs/beast-validation) project.


To give a flavour of the kind of things included, here is a summary of files involved in testing an operator. Rectangles represent files, ovals represent programs.

It is a living document: it is regularly updated every time we learn a bit more about how to make sure that the models that we develop are of the highest quality. A pdf version is available [here](https://github.com/rbouckaert/DeveloperManual/raw/master/output/DeveloperManual.pdf).
