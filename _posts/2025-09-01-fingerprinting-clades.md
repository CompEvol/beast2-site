[Previously](https://www.beast2.org/2024/04/02/optimising-code.html), we looked at some general optimisation techniques applied to calculating the conditional clade distribution. In particular CCD0 (Berling et al, 2025), this requires finding all clades $$S$$ and all pairs of clades $$C1$$, $$C2$$ in $$S$$ such that $$C1$$ and $$C2$$ disjoint and $$C1\cup C2$$ form a clade $$C$$ in $$S$$.

We group clades from $$S$$ in buckets of the same size, so that we can check for all $$C$$ in a bucket of size $$k$$ whether $$C1$$ is in bucket of size $$i$$, then $$C2$$ must be in bucket of size $$k-i$$.
only checking whether the smaller of buckets[another 
This allows for some particular optimisations, such as only checking the smallest of buckets $$i$$ and bucket $$k-i$$, sorting entries in buckets by the lowest taxon in a clade and checking only entries in a bucket that have equal or higher starting taxon than starting taxon in $$C$$, and something similar for the last taxon (see [this post](https://www.beast2.org/2025/03/01/CCD0-revisited.html) for more details).

## Fingerprinting clades

Recently, a preprint of the paper on Delphy (Varilly et al, 2025) pointed out a nice technique to manage clade sets.
Instead of BitSets (as used in the current implementation of CCDs) us a fingerprint.
Each taxon is assigned a number of type long randomly generated, and for each clade the fingerprint is calculated as the exclusive or of the fingerprints of its two child clades.

Since xor is commutative ($$A \oplus B = B \oplus A$$), the order in which child clade coalesc does not matter for the fingerprint of clade $$C$$:
the fingerprint is in fact always equal to the xor of all the taxa in the clade.

The most expensive test in building a CCD0 is determining whether $$C1\cup C2=S$$ under the condition $$C1\cap C2=\emptyset$$, since this requires BitSet operators that are computationally expensive.
Fortunately, fingerprints can help out here: if $$C1\cup C2=S$$ then
$$f(C1) \oplus f(C2) = f(S)$$ were $$f(.)$$ is the fingerprint of a clade.
This is a necessary but not sufficient condition to test $$C1\cup C2=S$$ with $$C1$$ and $$C2$$ disjoint: if $$C1=\{A\}, C2=\{A,B,C\}, S=\{A,C\}$$, that is $$C2$$ is the parent clade of $$C1$$ and $$S$$, we still have $$f(C1) \oplus f(C2) = f(S)$$ since $$f(C1) \oplus f(S) = f(C2)$$.
Another necessary condition is that the size of $$C1$$ plus the size of $$C2$$ must be equal to the size of $$S$$.
Note that this implicitly tests that $$C1$$ and $$C2$$ are disjoint.
If one of these conditions fails, we can be sure there is no match.
If these conditions succeed, we can be almost sure there is a match, with a very small probability we get a false positive due to randomness of the fingerprints of taxa.
However, this probability is vanishingly small, even for large taxon sets (see Varilly et al, 2025).


## Performance

Implementing this for the CCD0 point estimate in TreeAnnotator, we can measure the performance difference for large tree sets.
Most optimisations not involving BitSets still apply.
For a tree set with 6636 taxa, 9000 trees, 282812 clades and 2271899 clade splits (the updated global language tree set from Bouckaert et al, 2022) there is about a 10x speedup in calculating the point estimate.
The point estimate does not differ from that of the implementation using BitSets.
