title: Using R to estimate probability distribution parameters using quantiles or HPD intervals

This post is written by Jordan Douglas.

If you know some of the quantiles of a probability distribution (eg. <code>P(X < 5) = 0.05</code>, <code>P(X < 10) = 0.95</code>) and you know the name of the distribution but you do not know its parameters, then you can use R to estimate them.

This can be done using the cumulative distribution functions (pnorm for normal, plnorm for lognormal, pexp for exponential etc.). Parameter values which yield a small difference between observed and calculated cumulative probabilities can be found using the optim function.

For example, suppose that you want to find mu and sigma parameters of a lognormal distribution such that <code>P(X < 5) = 0.05</code> and <code>P(X < 10) = 0.95</code>. We start at <code>mu = 1</code> and <code>sigma = 1</code>.

<blockquote>
> mu = 1
> sigma = 1
> x1 = 5
> x2 = 10
> p1 = 0.05
> p2 = 0.95
> plnorm(x1, mu, sigma)
[1] 0.7288829
> plnorm(x2, mu, sigma)
[1] 0.9036418
</blockquote>

These initial values are a poor fit.

Next we generate an error function, in this case we minimize the sum of squared differences between calculated and observed cumulative probabilities.

<blockquote>
> errorFn = function(params) (plnorm(x1, params[1], params[2]) - p1)^2 + (plnorm(x2, params[1], params[2]) - p2)^2
</blockquote>

Finally, we call optim to find estimates for sigma and mu:

<blockquote>
> optim( c(mu, sigma), errorFn)
$par
[1] 1.9560118 0.2107083

$value
[1] 5.499438e-11
...
</blockquote>

Thus, the estimates for mu and sigma are 1.956 and 0.211 respectively, which have a sum of squared residuals of 5.5e-11.
