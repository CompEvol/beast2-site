Two new tutorials were created related to multi species coalescent models.

### StarBeast3 tutorial

[StarBeast3](https://github.com/rbouckaert/starbeast3) is a package for multi species coalescent that is useful when you have sequence data for each of the loci.
More details in this [blog post](https://www.beast2.org/2022/03/31/starbeast3.html).

The tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/rbouckaert/starbeast3/blob/master/workshop/README.md).

### Species delimitation tutorial

[Speedemon](https://github.com/rbouckaert/speedemon) is a package for species delimitation based on the Yule-skyline collapse model.
See [this post](https://www.beast2.org/2022/08/01/speedemon.html) for more details.

A tutorial for speedemon with SNP data and based on [snapper](https://github.com/rbouckaert/snapper) can be found [here](https://github.com/rbouckaert/speedemon/blob/master/tutorial/README.md).
