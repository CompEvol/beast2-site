<p>BEAUti has many bug fixes and enhancements for supporting multiple paritions better. In particular, you can now <b>clone</b> site models and clock models; just select a set of models from the list in the Site Model or Clock Model panel, and the rest of the panel is filled with a &#8220;Clone From&#8221; selector. This makes it much easier to set all site models to say HKY + 4 gamma categories with estimated frequencies.</p>
<p>The <b>AddOnManager</b> has gotten a facelift. Dependent packages can be automatically installed and uninstalled. You can specify other package repositories than the default one that BEAST uses.</p>
<p>BEAUti can now import <b>FASTA</b> files next to NEXUS files and alignments from BEAST1 and BEAST2 XML files.</p>
<p><b>SequenceSimulator</b> and <b>LogAnalyser</b> are enhanced to support simulation studies (more on this soon in this blog).</p>
<p>Distributions can be marked stochastic, so when the MCMC inner loop does a sanity check to ensure the incrementally calculated posterior remains the same as a freshly calculated posterior, these distributions can be ignored.</p>
<p>BEAUti automatically updates weights of *BEAST related operators so that the total times spent on *BEAST operators is 20%. This is believed to enhance *BEAST mixing.</p>
<h2>New in BEAST-packages</h2>
<p>To access packages, you should install them using the <a href="managing-packages.html">install them</a> first.</p>
<h2>New in BEAST-labs</h2>
<p>BEAST-labs &#8212; formerly known as BEASTii &#8212; now contains a <b>Script</b> class that allows you to use Javascript (as well as other script languages like python and ruby, provided the appropriate script engine is in the class path). With a Script object you can log complex information that would otherwise require writing a new Java class.</p>
<p>Path sampling/stepping stone analyses is moved to the model selection package.</p>
<h2>New in model-selection package</h2>
<p>The model-selection package supports path sampling/stepping stone analyses. There is a simple <b>GUI</b> for setting up a path sampling/stepping stone analysis.</p>
<p>The package supports <b>pairwise path sampling/stepping stone analysis</b> where you can estimate the difference of marginal likelihood between two models. This is in general more efficient than estimating marginal likelihoods for each of the two models appart.</p>
<h2>New in SNAPP</h2>
<p>SNAPP now contains a simple <b>SNP caller</b> &#8212; it looks at the first sequence in the alignment, and assumes that the characters there represent the zero value for the site. This means you can use a nucleotide sequence directly in a SNAPP analysis, instead of having to convert it to a binary sequence first.</p>
<p>Tip texts in BEAUti are improved.</p>
<h2>New in BDSKY</h2>
<p>Robustify against incorrect input, and remove intervalNumber-input.</p>
<h2>New packages</h2>
<p>Some new packages were added:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/tgvaughan/feast'>Feast</a></li>
<li><a href='http://www.indriid.com/dissectinbeast.html'>DISSECT: species delimitation with *BEAST</a></li>
</ul>
