<p>When a bug is discovered that holds you up, and it is relatively easy to fix, the fix may already be in the code but not released yet. The release process takes quite a bit of time, so it is not something we like to do very often. However, you can still use the fixed code (and possibly some new experimental code as well) by using the development build. Every time code is checked in, a new <tt><a href="http://hudson.cs.auckland.ac.nz/job/BEAST2/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/dist/beast.jar">beast.jar</a></tt> file is build and made available for download from <a href="http://hudson.cs.auckland.ac.nz/job/BEAST2/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/dist/beast.jar">here</a>. This file contains all runnable code for running BEAST and BEAUti, but not the BEAUti templates (XML files for setting up analyses in BEAUti). Only if all regression tests pass, the jar becomes available, so that should give some confidence that new code did not break any previous functionality.</p>
<p>I am assuming you already have BEAST installed before, so the Standard and StarBEAST BEAUti templates are on your computer. Note that it is important to store the <tt>beast.jar</tt> file in the <tt>lib</tt> folder (details below), so it picks up the BEAUti templates from the correct lcoation. For running BEAST, it does not matter<br />
where you store the jar file.</p>
<h2>Using <tt>beast.jar</tt> on Windows</h2>
<p>When you download BEAST you get a zip file. I will assume that BEAST is unzipped on drive C, so there is a directory <tt>C:\BEAST</tt>. If it is located in another place, you will need to replace &#8220;C:\BEAST&#8221; with wherever BEAST is located.</p>
<h3>1. Download <tt>beast.jar</tt></h3>
<p>First, download <tt><a href="http://hudson.cs.auckland.ac.nz/job/BEAST2/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/dist/beast.jar">beast.jar</a></tt> and store it in <tt>C:\BEAST\lib</tt>.<br />
The directory <tt>C:\BEAST\lib</tt> already contains the <tt>beast.jar</tt> file that comes with the release, which you might want to back-up. It is not used by BEAST.exe or BEAUti.exe, so it does not affect the installed GUI versions of BEAST and BEAUti.</p>
<h3>2. Running BEAUti</h3>
<p>To run BEAUti, open the Command Prompt window by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, and then clicking Command Prompt (more <a href="http://www.c3scripts.com/tutorials/msdos/open-window.html">here</a><br />
if you are not familiar with the cmd prompt). In the cmd screen, key in the<br />
following two lines:</p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight xml %}cd c:\BEAST
java -cp lib\beast.jar beast.app.beauti.Beauti{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p>and the familiar BEAUti screen should be shown.</p>
<h3>3. Running BEAST</h3>
<p>To run BEAST on <tt>MyBEASTFile.xml</tt>, open a CMD prompt and key in the following:</p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight xml %}cd c:\BEAST
java -jar lib\beast.jar MyBEASTFile.xml{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p><b>Note:</b> running from the command line tends to make<br />
BEAST run faster on Windows, so that is another reason to use BEAST from the command line.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> use <tt>java -jar ... </tt> instead of <tt>java -cp ...</tt> as used for running BEAUti.</p>
<h2>Using <tt>beast.jar</tt> on Mac</h2>
<p>Assuming you installed BEAST in <tt>/Applications/BEAST 2.1.1/</tt> where 2.1.1 is the version number of BEAST. If you installed another version, you have to replace wherever it says 2.1.1 below with that version number.</p>
<h3>1. Download <tt>beast.jar</tt></h3>
<p>First download <tt><a href="http://hudson.cs.auckland.ac.nz/job/BEAST2/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/dist/beast.jar">beast.jar</a></tt> and store it in <tt>/Applications/BEAST 2.1.1/lib</tt>.</p>
<h3>2. Running BEAUti</h3>
<p>To run BEAUti, open a terminal and key in the following two lines</p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight xml %}cd /Applications/BEAST 2.1.1
java -cp lib/beast.jar beast.app.beauti.Beauti{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p>and the familiar BEAUti screen should be shown.</p>
<h3>3. Running BEAST</h3>
<p>To run BEAST on <tt>MyBEASTFile.xml</tt>, open a CMD prompt and key in the following:</p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight xml %}cd /Applications/BEAST 2.1.1
java -jar lib/beast.jar MyBEASTFile.xml{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> use <tt>java -jar ... </tt> instead of <tt>java -cp ...</tt> as used for running BEAUti.</p>
<h2>Using <tt>beast.jar</tt> on Linux</h2>
<p>Like for Mac, but with <tt>/Applications/BEAST 2.1.1/</tt> replaced with the directory where you installed BEAST.</p>
