<p><span id="What_units_are_species_tree_divergences_from_.2ABEAST_analysis_in.3F" class="mw-headline"></span>Let $r_i$ be the estimated relative rate for locus $i$ and let $L_i$ be the number of sites in locus $i$. If *BEAST is run with the mean substitution rate across partitions fixed to 1, and the clock rate fixed to 1, then the following is true:</p>
<p>&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sum_i r_i L_i}{\sum_i L_i} = 1, &lt;/math&gt;</p>
