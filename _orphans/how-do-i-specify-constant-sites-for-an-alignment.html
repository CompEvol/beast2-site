<p><span id="How_do_I_specify_constant_sites_for_an_alignment" class="mw-headline"></span>You can use a FilteredAlignment to insert constant sites and set the constantSiteWeights attribute. Say, your original alignment is called xyz, so the XML produced by BEAUti contains something like</p>
{% highlight xml %}   <data id="xyz" name="alignment">
</data>{% endhighlight %}
<p>It is easiest to rename this to say xyzOriginal,</p>
{% highlight xml %}   <data id="xyzOriginal" name="alignment">
</data>{% endhighlight %}
<p>then add another data element, just after the closing  element of the alignment would be a good spot, that say</p>
{% highlight xml %}  <data id="xyz" spec="FilteredAlignment" filter="-" data="@xyzOriginal" constantsiteweights="100 200 300 400" />
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Note id='xyz' and data='@xyzOriginal' should match what you have in the XML.</p>
<p>The constant weights at the end add weights for DNA in order A,C,G,T, so it adds 100 constant sites with all As, 200 with all Cs etc.</p>
<p>In the output to screen, it should report statistics of the xyzOriginal as something like:</p>
{% highlight xml %} 6 taxa
 768 sites
 69 patterns
{% endhighlight %}
<p>followed by statistics of the filtered alignment</p>
{% highlight xml %} Filter -
 6 taxa
 768 sites + 1000 constant sites
 69 patterns
{% endhighlight %}
<p>where the total number of constant sites added are reported as well.</p>
