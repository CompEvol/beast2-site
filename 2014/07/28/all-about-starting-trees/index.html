<p>Before starting an MCMC run, BEAST uses <tt>State Node</tt> initialisers to set up the starting trees (and other parameters). Often a good starting tree is already available from another analysis (e.g. a maximum likelihood tree). Though it is against the spirit of MCMC, which guarantees any random starting state will lead to convergence, a good starting tree can help with large analysis to speed up convergence quite a bit. Of course another reason to specify a starting tree is if you want to do an analysis using just a single known tree topology.</p>
<p>We start with standard analysis, but see below for *BEAST analyses.</p>
<h2>Standard analysis</h2>
<p>For a standard analysis, there are three ways to specify a starting tree </p>
<ul>
<li>a random tree </li>
<li>a tree in Newick format</li>
<li>a cluster tree, e.g. through UPGMA or neighbour joining</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, BEAUti uses a RandomTree state-node initialiser to generate a starting tree. If you want to replace it with a Newick tree or cluster tree, first you need to remove (or comment out) the RandomTree element from the XML. For a tree in partition <tt>XYZ26</tt>, just search for <tt>RandomTree</tt> and remove the XML fragment with id <tt>RandomTree.t:XYZ26</tt>. It should look something like this:</p>
<p></p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight ruby %}<init estimate="false" id="RandomTree.t:XYZ26" initial="@Tree.t:XYZ26" spec="beast.evolution.tree.RandomTree" taxa="@XYZ26">
    <populationModel id="ConstantPopulation0.t:XYZ26" spec="ConstantPopulation">
        <parameter id="randomPopSize.t:XYZ26" name="popSize">1.0</parameter>
    </populationModel>
</init>{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
<p>Before removing, make note of the initial attribute (<tt>@Tree.t:XYZ26</tt>> here) and taxa attribute (<tt>@XYZ26</tt> here).</p>
<h3>Newick starting tree</h3>
<p>After removing the Random tree, in the same place, add a <tt>TreeParser</tt> using the following fragment</p>
<p></p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight ruby %}<init spec='beast.util.TreeParser' id='NewickTree.t:XYZ26' 
  initial="@Tree.t:XYZ26" taxa='@XYZ26' IsLabelledNewick="true" 
  newick="((your,(tree,goes)),here)"/>{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
<p>The attributes that you want to specify are</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>id="NewickTree.t:XYZ26"</tt> the ID should be unique, so something like <tt>NewickTree.t:</tt> plus the name of the tree would be suitable.
<li><tt>initial="@Tree.t:XYZ26"</tt> this refers to the tree being initialised. It should be the same as the initial attribute of the RandomTree that was removed.
<li><tt>taxa="@XYZ26"</tt> this refers to the alignment and ensures that taxa in the tree are lined with those in the alignment. For BEAST v2.1.x, this must be specified to prevent starting with a mislabelled tree
<li><tt>newick="((your,(tree,goes)),here)"</tt> obviously needs to be replaced with your own tree in Newick format.
<li>
</ul>
<p>This is all you need to know to set up a starting tree. There are a few optional attributes you can use to make life a bit easier:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>adjustTipHeights</tt> is true by default, which means tips of the tree will be set to zero, or if tip dates are specified to these particular tip dates. By setting to <tt>adjustTipHeights="false"</tt>, tips will be initialised by the heights in the Newick tree.
<li> if <tt>adjustTipHeights="false"</tt> then <tt>threshold</tt> specifies threshold under which node heights (derived from lengths) are set to zero. This helps when there are numeric issues with adding the lengths.
<li><tt>scale</tt> scale used to multiply internal node heights during parsing. Useful for importing starting from external programs, for instance, RaxML tree rooted using Path-o-gen.
<li><tt>IsLabelledNewick="true"</tt> Is the Newick tree labelled (alternatively contains node numbers)?
<li>If <tt>sLabelledNewick="false"</tt> then &#8220;<tt>offset="1"</tt>  is the lowest taxa number. The default=1 but 0 is common as well. Taxa numbers are as they are ordered in the alignment referred to with the <tt>taxa</tt> attribute.
<li>
</ul>
<h3>Cluster tree</h3>
<p>After removing the Random tree, in the same place, add a <tt>ClusterTree</tt> with the following fragment</p>
<p></p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight ruby %}<init spec='beast.util.ClusterTree' id='UPGMATree.t:XYZ26' 
  initial="@Tree.t:XYZ26" clusterType='upgma' 
  taxa='@XYZ26'/>{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
<p>The attributes that you need to specify are <tt>id='UPGMATree.t:XYZ26'</tt>, <tt>initial="@Tree.t:XYZ26"</tt> and <tt>taxa="@XYZ26"</tt>, which are as for Newick tree (see above).</p>
<p>You can use different clustering algorithms by specifying the <tt>clusterType="upgma"</tt> attribute.</p>

<h2>*BEAST analysis</h2>
<p>For a *BEAST analysis, the default in BEAUti is to generate a UPGMA tree for the species tree, then generate UPGMA trees for each of the gene trees and fit them inside the species tree. In previous incarnations of BEAST, a random tree was generated for species as well as for gene trees, but gene tree branches ending in leaves were lengthened such that each first coalescence of a gene tree was above the root of the species tree. Though this ensures that the gene trees fit inside the species tree, it leads to long burn-in times.</p>
<p>If you want to use a different starting tree for the species tree, first move (not remove!) the <tt>StarBeastStartState</tt> element generated by BEAUti to just before the run-element with <tt>id="mcmc"</tt>. BEAUti will have generated some elements inside the start-state (such as the species-tree-prior) that we need elsewhere in the analysis. By moving the init element outside the run element, it will not activate the <tt>StarBeastStartState</tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt>StarBeastStartState</tt> looks something like this:</p>
<p></p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight ruby %}<init birthRate="@birthRate.t:Species" estimate="false" id="SBI" popMean="@popMean" spec="beast.evolution.speciation.StarBeastStartState" speciesTree="@Tree.t:Species">
    <tree idref="Tree.t:29" name="gene"/>
    <tree idref="Tree.t:26" name="gene"/>
    <speciesTreePrior bottomPopSize="@popSize" gammaParameter="@popMean" id="SpeciesTreePopSize.Species" spec="beast.evolution.speciation.SpeciesTreePrior" taxonset="@taxonsuperset" tree="@Tree.t:Species"/>
</init>{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
<p>For every gene tree there will be a tree entry in the <tt>StarBeastStartState</tt>. To replace the species tree with a Newick tree, add the following fragment (at the place where the <tt>StarBeastStartState</tt> was):</p>
<p></p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight ruby %}<init spec='beast.util.TreeParser' id='NewickTree.t:Species' 
   initial="@Tree.t:Species" taxonset='@taxonsuperset' 
   IsLabelledNewick="true" 
   newick="((your,(tree,goes)),here)"/>{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
<p>The only thing to set up is the Newick using the <tt>newick</tt> attribute &#8212; all other attributes should be as they are (it is using the species tree, which is identified by the Species partition in every *BEAST analysis generated by BEAUti).</p>
<p>For each of the gene trees, you need to specify a tree as well. You can specify them using a Newick tree as for the Standard analysis (see above). Alternatively, you can use a random tree that is placed &#8216;above&#8217; the species tree. To do this, you add for the first gene tree (just below the new Species tree start tree):</p>
<p></p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight ruby %}<init spec='beast.evolution.speciation.RandomGeneTree' 
      id='randomGeneTree1' initial='@Tree.t:26' 
      speciesTree='@Tree.t:Species' taxa='@26'>
  <populationModel id='popmodel' spec='ConstantPopulation' popSize="1.0"/>
</init>{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
<p>where you replace the <tt>initial='@Tree.t:26'</tt> and <tt>taxa="@26"</tt> attributes to match your tree (instead of 26, as in this example). For every subsequent gene tree, you add (below the first gene start tree):</p>
<p></p>

		
		
			
			
			
			{% highlight ruby %}<init spec='beast.evolution.speciation.RandomGeneTree' 
  id='randomGeneTree2' initial='@Tree.t:29' 
  speciesTree='@Tree.t:Species' taxa='@29'   
  populationModel='@popmodel'/>{% endhighlight %}			
			
		

<p></p>
<p>where you replace the <tt>initial='@Tree.t:29'</tt> and <tt>taxa="@29"</tt> attributes to match your tree (instead of 29) and make sure the id is unique.</p>
