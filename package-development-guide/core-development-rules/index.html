<h2>Version numbers </h2>
<p>BEAST 2 versions have the triplet form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.</p>
<p>MAJOR is incremented when a substantial portion of the system is reimplemented from scratch, resulting in large changes to both the UI and API.</p>
<p>MINOR is incremented whenever enhancements are included that alter the API in a non-backwards-compatible manner.</p>
<p>PATCH is incremented whenever bug fixes or small enhancements are included that do not alter the API or that do so in a backwards-compatible manner.</p>
