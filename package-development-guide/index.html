<p>BEAST 2 is designed to be extended easily through the BEAST 2 package system. A package houses java code that may implement a probability distribution, a new state component, a new set of MCMC operators, or a combination of all (or none) of these &#8211; it&#8217;s up to you! In addition, the package also specifies how these abstract concepts relate to the BEAST&#8217;s BEAUti graphical interface.</p>
<p>The following pages will walk you through the process of creating your own BEAST 2 package.</p>
