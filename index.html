<p>BEAST 2 is a cross-platform program for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequences. It estimates rooted, time-measured phylogenies using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST 2 uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. BEAST 2 includes a graphical user-interface for setting up standard analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>The latest version of BEAST 2 is version 2.7.6. To install this version, 
select one of the following  to download the version for your operating system:

<h2 class="p1">Version 2</h2>
<p>BEAST 2 is a rewrite of <a class="external text" href="http://beast.community/" rel="nofollow">BEAST 1.x</a>, placing a greater emphasis on modularity. This makes it easier to extend BEAST 2 via its package system. As a result, BEAST 2 has rapidly acquired the ability to perform a diverse array of model-based analyses. For a comparison of features/models currently available in BEAST 2 with those currently implemented in BEAST 1, refer to this <a href="./features/">features table.</a></p>
<h2>Getting Started </h2>
<p>As BEAST 2 is such a large and complicated application, first-time users may find coming to grips with the program and its capabilities a daunting task. We therefore encourage you to perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarise yourself with the <a title="Glossary" href="./glossary/index.html">terminology</a> used by BEAST 2 users and developers.</li>
<li>Work through the available <a href="./tutorials/index.html">tutorials</a>, particularly those applicable to your data.</li>
<li>Join the users mailing list by visiting the <a class="external text" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beast-users" rel="nofollow">beast-users group</a> or sending an email to <a class="external text" href="mailto:beast-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com" rel="nofollow">beast-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com</a>. This list is used to announce new versions and to advise users about bugs and other problems.</li>
<li>Attend the <a href="https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cevo/taming-the-beast.html">Taming the BEAST</a> workshop.</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing these introductory steps, you&#8217;ll be well equipped to dive into the <a class="external text" href="./book/index.html" rel="nofollow">BEAST 2 Book</a>.</p>
<h2>BEAST 2 Packages </h2>
<p>In BEAST 2, many models and analysis methods are implemented as BEAST 2 Packages. This means that the package is developed and maintained separately to BEAST 2 itself. To access these methods, you must download the corresponding packages <i>in addition</i> to BEAST 2. This is made easy by the BEAST 2 Package Manager, which is part of BEAST 2&#8217;s graphical user interface. See the <a title="Managing Packages" href="./managing-packages/index.html">Managing Packages</a> page for details.</p>
<p>A list of known currently-available packages is provided in the BEAST 2/BEAST 1 <a title="BEAST Features" href="./beast-features/index.html">feature comparison table</a>.</p>
<h2>Dealing with Problems and Performance Issues </h2>
<p>While we aim to make using BEAST 2 a pleasant experience, problems do sometimes arise. In such cases, the following, please review the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation of <a title="Error Messages" href="./error-messages/index.html">error messages</a> and their meanings.</li>
<li>The list of <a title="FAQ" href="./faq/index.html">frequently asked questions</a> (FAQ).</li>
</ul>
<p>For performance-related issues, refer to this handy list of <a title="Performance Suggestions" href="./performance-suggestions/index.html">suggestions for improving performance</a>.</p>
<h2>Package Development </h2>
<p>BEAST 2 is <i>designed</i> to be extended. Prospective package developers should refer to the <a title="Package Development Guide" href="package-development-guide/">Package Development Guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Who develops BEAST?</h2>
<p>BEAST 2 is developed by a team of scientists around the world. This web site is managed by the <a href="http://compevol.auckland.ac.nz/">Centre for Computational Evolution</a>.</p>
